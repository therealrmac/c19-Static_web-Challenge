	<section id="bio">
		<p>I was born in Cynthiana KY in August 6th, 1989 at Harrison Memorial Hospital in Harrison County. I am the youngest of two, I have an older Sister that was born in September 23rd, 1986. I played sports throughout most of my life growing up but once I got to High school I only stuck with Football since it was my favorite.  I graduated from grade school in 2008 under the last term of George W Bush, and went to Morehead State Univeristy for college.  I studied computer science while I was there and learned how to use Python, c++, and Java. I worked at a medical laboratory for 4 years from the time that I was 23 until 27, and in that time I also attendted classes online through ITT-Tech learning web development and front end programming.  You may have heard however, that ITT-Tech went under and thus I was unable to complete my training there.  So now I have come to NSS to seek that so desired field of study.</p>
